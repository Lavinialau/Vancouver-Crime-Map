# Interactive Crime Map in Vancouver

By studying historic crime data, we can analyze the crime trend to identify people and locations at increased risk of crime, and allocate police to patrol at appropriate locations prior to crime happening.

In this project, an interactive crime map is developed to study crime activities at different neighborhoods. The data is dynamic and is automatically updated when [Vancouver Police Department](http://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/crime-data.htm) updates their data.

# How to read the map?

The interactive crime map was developed for the public to observe the crime trend in different time. Users can zoom in the map or mouse over the map to see the crime details.

For example, from October 1-13, 2017, crime mainly happened in downtown, which is indicated in red. If a place is indicated in yellow, it means the crime is less likely to happen. And green means crime is least likely to happen. (Figure 1)
