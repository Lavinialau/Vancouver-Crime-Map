# Interactive Crime Map in Vancouver

By studying historic crime data, we can analyze the crime trend to identify people and locations at increased risk of crime, and allocate police to patrol at appropriate locations prior to crime happening.

In this project, an interactive crime map is developed to study crime activities at different neighborhoods. The data is dynamic and is automatically updated when [Vancouver Police Department](http://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/crime-data.htm) updates their data.
